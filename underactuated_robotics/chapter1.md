# Chapter 1

Underactuated robotics focuses on building control systems that use natural dynamics to achieve an improvement on performance, such as speed, efficiency and robustness.

###What makes ASIMO's walk so unnatural?
"ASIMO walks a bit like somebody who is unfamiliar with his/her own dynamics"
It use high-gain feedback, and therefore considerable joint torque.

Stiff more accurate joints lead to a higher consumption in energy, about 20 times the energy (scaled) that an average human uses to walk.

ASIMO can't walk nearly as quickly as human, and can't walk on uneven terrain.


Drive away from conservative machines, and towards and approach the makes use of dynamics.
